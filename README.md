1. Yes, please send the description of your project in advance, so we would know what to expect

2. It is welcomed, that you send us a link to github, so we could see and review your code. We understand, that your research can have some crucial data, that you don't want to or can't share. So it is not needed for you to show us your real working repo - you can create a separate demo repo.

3. There are no strict rules about your code architecture, but consider, that we may want to run your code on another device. So it would be great, if you provide requirements.txt in your repo and provide links to libs, which can't be installed with pip/conda (if there are some of those in your code)

4. Provide a presentation, where you briefly describe your project, how it correlates with your research (if it correlates), how you implemented your project, what did you do for optimization and which results did you achieve

Good luck with your projects!
